Dr Dominic McAfee has been playing this sound underwater to help regenerate natural oyster reefs. He&amp;apos;s been doing this work for years, but recently, there&amp;apos;s been an upswell in interest, as the South Australian government tries to increase resilience against a harmful algal bloom. The ongoing environmental crisis has killed hundreds of species and resulted in tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands of marine deaths. Dr McAfee says South Australia used to be home to huge oyster reefs, which would have curbed the intensity of the algal bloom because they naturally filter the water. He’s speaking here with SBS&amp;apos;s Tee Mitchell, who started by asking about the role and extent of oyster reefs before colonisation.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">f864e21d1ac8ac91530408173825f28f</guid></item><item><title>Christmas lights return to Bethlehem for first time since Gaza war</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/bethlehem-christmas-lights-gaza-war/72u27hiyp</link><description>A giant Christmas tree adorned with red and gold baubles stands in the West Bank city of Bethlehem for the first time since 2022.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">13eab7ee107bf4465a459d58b4cc1745</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;A very painful day&amp;apos;: India nightclub fire in Goa leaves 25 people dead</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/nightclub-fire-in-goa-india-kills-23/hzfqlwvge</link><description>A fire in a nightclub in India&amp;apos;s tourist hot spot of Goa has killed 25 people.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">a1ca59c871bf7546df7d872f8f983cf2</guid></item><item><title>Minister defends taxpayer-funded trips as Coalition pushes for independent review</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/anika-wells-defends-taxpayer-funded-trip-costs/kc6e3jizp</link><description>The communications minister is not indicating she will pay back any money as she comes under renewed fire for the cost of taxpayer-funded trips.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">50f83d7a2b66e079b5d7b94a46874ca5</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;That&amp;apos;s not neutrality&amp;apos;: Protesters call on SBS to boycott Eurovision</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/thats-not-neutrality-protesters-call-on-sbs-to-boycott-eurovision/hjcaiveg8</link><description>Protesters have demanded SBS boycott the Eurovision Song Contest over Israel’s participation, but the public broadcaster said such a move would undermine its editorial independence.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">7123080728b01f9aabaffd61111e515c</guid></item><item><title>What I didn’t expect when I used $11k from my super to freeze my eggs at 25</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/insight/article/i-accessed-my-super-early-to-freeze-my-eggs-when-i-was-25/mgej30565</link><description>After being diagnosed with a condition that can affect fertility, Libby Wilson withdrew around $11k of her super to freeze her eggs.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">02dd30ba7ced56d0b6a68b0783fcb2aa</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;It&amp;apos;s nasty&amp;apos;: Could this virus spark the world&amp;apos;s next pandemic?</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/could-bird-flu-become-the-next-global-pandemic/1ung1to27</link><description>Epidemiologists are keeping a close eye on the H5 bird flu strains that are present in parts of the world.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">30c99d43b1a0f0bcb0eb2a38b82293f3</guid></item><item><title>Netanyahu says phase two of Gaza peace plan nears but key disputes remain</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/netanyahu-says-phase-two-of-gaza-peace-plan-nears-but-key-disputes-remain/b4txrny3y</link><description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that progress toward the second phase of a US-backed plan to end the Gaza war is close.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">cec2dd0d7e188013380beeddfbf0e459</guid></item><item><title>Netanyahu says Israel nearing phase two of Gaza Ceasefire Plan</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/netanyahu-says-israel-nearing-phase-two-of-gaza-ceasefire-plan/m0fu9wjc9</link><description>Israel is close to moving into the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cautioning that the next steps will be “more difficult” as tensions continue over Hamas’s disarmament, Gaza’s future governance, and the stalled two-state solution.

As they wrapped up a 12-day tour of facilities across the country, preliminary findings raise substantial concerns around the over-representation of First Nations people, punitive policies that target children, rising rates of remand and mandatory detention, among other issues. The federal immigration detention regime was also found to contravene fundamental international human rights norms - including the Commonwealth&amp;apos;s recent deal with Nauru to deport stateless people. Australia’s Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay says the findings show Australia is not complying with key international human rights commitments it has made to the world.

The National Firearms Agreement was introduced after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre to standardise rules about who could own a gun - and why. But experts on firearms legislation say some holes in the rules have become apparent. In New South Wales, applications to have a firearms licence are handled by the Gun Registry - which came under intense scrutiny after a tragic murder suicide in 2018, when an estranged father, John Edwards, fatally shot his teenage children. He had a history of domestic violence which hadn&amp;apos;t been flagged to the Gun Registry. Not all the changes recommended after the Edwards inquest have been implemented. Deborah Groarke spoke to Maya Arguello who&amp;apos;s a law and criminology expert at the Swinburne University of Technology.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ed71de71a02654ee40aa1d5597a5433b</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;We will not give in to fear&amp;apos;: Vigils held across Australia to honour victims of Bondi terror attack</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/vigils-held-across-australia-to-honour-victims-of-bondi-terror-attack/h4anapf91</link><description>&amp;quot;We gather not in fear, but in strength,&amp;quot; Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann told the crowd at Melbourne&amp;apos;s Pillar of Light festival.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">abc0e3ead1a9ddb0d60830ec849dbad1</guid></item><item><title>Six still in critical condition after Bondi attack | Midday News Bulletin 16 December 2025</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/six-still-in-critical-condition-after-bondi-attack-midday-news-bulletin-16-december-2025/ogydcmd96</link><description>Six still in a critical condition after Sunday&amp;apos;s Bondi attack; Donald Trump slammed for his response to the murder of US director Rob Reiner; Melbourne Renegades off to a winning start in the Big Bash League.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">7f7d607b7946a20031ba273960239ac4</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;Feel like such a hero&amp;apos;: The Australians who shattered blood donation records</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/bondi-terror-attack-what-to-know-about-giving-blood/f48vu6q70</link><description>Australians have broken national blood donation records as some centres are booked up until the end of January.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">3dbc71000cdd8cccf0e4544da0955c53</guid></item><item><title>SBS News in Easy English 16 December 2025</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/sbs-news-in-easy-english-16-december-2025/zmvrzkkt7</link><description>A daily 5-minute news wrap for English learners and people with disability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">3d18e8915a9924994ca95dee456c2fd0</guid></item><item><title>Donald Trump sues the BBC, seeking billions in damages</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/donald-trump-sues-bbc-defamation/xh5qs7jmo</link><description>The BBC apologised to the US president last month, but said it strongly disagreed that there were grounds for a defamation claim.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">67f4176dac3ab54f7627a9609f3fa6b8</guid></item><item><title>Light over darkness: the global Jewish community unites in tragedy</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/light-over-darkness-the-global-jewish-community-unites-in-tragedy/wacom07yx</link><description>.A mass shooting at one of Australia&amp;apos;s most famous beaches, targeting revellers at a Jewish holiday celebration, has generated shock and grief around the world.
