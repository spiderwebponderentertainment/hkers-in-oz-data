Mr Mamdani, the first Muslim to be elected mayor of the biggest U.S. city, defeated former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent after losing the nomination to Mamdani earlier this year. Mr Cuomo, who resigned as governor four years ago after sexual harassment allegations that he has denied, painted Mr Mamdani as a radical leftist whose proposals were unworkable and dangerous. Mr Mamdani himself has proposed raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy to pay for ambitious policies such as rent freezes, free childcare and free city buses. But like other winning candidates from the off-year elections, Mr Mamdani focused intensely on economic issues, particularly the cost of living, an issue that helped propel U.S. President, Donald Trump, to the White House last year but has remained top-of-mind for voters. In this episode of weeke nd omne-on-one, we hear from Eric Gander, who&amp;apos;s the chair of the Department of Communications at New York&amp;apos;s Baruch College.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">046921ed942ac4494c7aad60edace58e</guid></item><item><title>Behind Zohran Mamdani&amp;apos;s historic win, and what it means for the Democratic Party&amp;apos;s future</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/how-will-zohran-mamdani-affect-us-politics/nwxpbg5cj</link><description>The mayor-elect of New York City was just one of the Democrats to win an election this week.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">780bb083212a6ecfc7e941d85376da46</guid></item><item><title>Mexico&amp;apos;s president was groped on the street.

The head of the BBC, director-general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness both resigned after criticism of the broadcaster’s editing of a speech by US President Donald Trump. Critics said the way the speech was edited for the BBC&amp;apos;s flagship documentary program Panorama last year was misleading and cut out a section where Donald Trump said that he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. Mr Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC over the way the speech he made was edited. Julie Posetti is a professor of journalism at City St George&amp;apos;s University of London and director for the International Centre for Journalists and she&amp;apos;s speaking here to AP.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c6f82c58ef8334b8925097a9cb7b8c37</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;No other alternative&amp;apos;: Howard weighs in on Whitlam&amp;apos;s controversial dismissal</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/john-howard-weighs-in-on-gough-whitlams-dismissal/geaumvze0</link><description>John Howard, part of the Opposition at the time of the dismissal, said then governor-general Sir John Kerr made the right call.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">9aa46150e9607ff6c06a442c7f7e9c1e</guid></item><item><title>Deadly car blast near India’s Red Fort kills at least eight</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/deadly-car-blast-near-indias-red-fort-kills-at-least-eight/sdrpmcv7r</link><description>A powerful car explosion near New Delhi’s historic Red Fort has killed at least eight people and injured around twenty others.
