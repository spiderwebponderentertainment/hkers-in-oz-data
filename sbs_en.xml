The head of the BBC, director-general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness both resigned after criticism of the broadcaster’s editing of a speech by US President Donald Trump. Critics said the way the speech was edited for the BBC&amp;apos;s flagship documentary program Panorama last year was misleading and cut out a section where Donald Trump said that he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. Mr Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC over the way the speech he made was edited. Julie Posetti is a professor of journalism at City St George&amp;apos;s University of London and director for the International Centre for Journalists and she&amp;apos;s speaking here to AP.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c6f82c58ef8334b8925097a9cb7b8c37</guid></item><item><title>SBS News in Easy English 11 November 2025</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/sbs-news-in-easy-english-11-november-2025/0v13l4byz</link><description>A five minute bulletin for English Language learners</description><guid isPermaLink="false">eb987a294973d29c8f81584d464e52f2</guid></item><item><title>Why consumers are optimistic despite inflation &amp;amp; CBA Q2 profit rises 2%</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/why-consumers-are-optimistic-despite-inflation-cba-q2-profit-rises-2/2fb8jxq6d</link><description>SBS Finance Editor Ricardo Gonçalves speaks with Westpac&amp;apos;s Matt Hassan about a dramatic rise in consumer confidence, despite reaccelerating inflation and diminishing prospects of lower interest rates; plus the day on the sharemarket with Jamie Hannah from VanEck, including a closer look at the Commonwealth Bank&amp;apos;s latest profit result.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">2c275cd63eca036d04507c1dab7b3eb9</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;You could die, make a will&amp;apos;: Australia&amp;apos;s fresh warning amid &amp;apos;dark&amp;apos; travel trend</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/australias-fresh-travel-warning-amid-dark-travel-trend/iqecjtaqf</link><description>Australians have been kidnapped, detained and targeted by terror attacks in this central Asian country, Smartraveller warns.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">83cdda00445652f8db1e0e71021abef7</guid></item><item><title>The Dismissal: how it all played out</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/the-dismissal-how-it-all-played-out/1s5ql15ph</link><description>On November 11, 1975, Australia experienced its most dramatic constitutional crisis when Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam 50 years ago.
