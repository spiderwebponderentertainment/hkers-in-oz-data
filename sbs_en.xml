For more on this, Stephanie Youssef spoke with HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham. Despite the decision, the Australian share market finished the session strong, amid a strong global stocks rebound that included a gold and silver price recovery.

In Mildura, in Victoria&amp;apos;s far northwest, the mercury hit 48.6 Celsius. And when coastal areas enjoyed a reprieve, the inland still had to cope with an extended heatwave that lasted a week. Experts say these kinds of phenomena are going to intensify over time because of the impacts of climate change - but while there has been plenty of coverage of how that impacts on urban centres, regional Australia has not received the same attention. SBS visited Mildura to see how the region felt the heat, and what they&amp;apos;re doing to cope with climate change at a local level.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e530a064349eb49a4668efe5fd936f34</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;Bloodbath&amp;apos;: Mass layoffs at Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/washington-post-layoffs/y2dd49wsv</link><description>The shrinking of the prominent masthead comes as major media outlets in the US face intense pressure from Donald Trump.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">3a84e5765efdb90a112b2f37ac6da267</guid></item><item><title>Iran-US nuclear talks back on, set for Friday in Oman</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks/ee9dz5d3m</link><description>Talks will go ahead following weeks of increasing tensions between the two countries.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c7ae389b6dfc535ed3b534210e241fbe</guid></item><item><title>Iran-US nuclear talks back on, set for Friday in Oman</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-in-oman/ee9dz5d3m</link><description>Talks will go ahead following weeks of increasing tensions between the two countries.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">6dcb89b6f084507dda8abfa51a51d45c</guid></item><item><title>Bondi stabbing inquest findings handed down | Midday News Bulletin 5 February 2026</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/bondi-stabbing-inquest-findings-handed-down-midday-news-bulletin-5-february-2026/opju8ubx7</link><description>A coroner hands down findings from an inquest into the fatal stabbing of six people at Bondi last year;

That&amp;apos;s the shocking finding from the Cancer Council Australia’s latest national survey, which suggests the financial burden arises from both direct medical costs and indirect expenses at every stage of the cancer journey.

There&amp;apos;s a particular focus on the United States and what the international body describes as its erosion of human rights, but there is also a spotlight on Australia.

New South Wales State Coroner Teresa O&amp;apos;Sullivan criticised the care of Joel Cauchi&amp;apos;s former psychiatrist for failing to adequately respond to a schizophrenia relapse in the years before the mass stabbing, which saw six people killed and 10 injured. She has made 23 recommendations, including a call for the Health Ombudsman of Queensland to review the psychiatrist&amp;apos;s care and treatment of Joel Cauchi.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">cb735555d32f93669af86e516836c610</guid></item><item><title>Police investigating after mosque receives second threatening letter</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/police-invesigating-after-threatning-letter-sent-to-sydney-mosque/a3a2jlq25</link><description>The Lebanese Muslim Association says community members are increasingly telling them they feel unsafe.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">8fb765ff24911373829d5dd27e87c884</guid></item><item><title>Software sell-off continues and bitcoin tumbles</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/software-sell-off-continues-bitcoin-tumbles/5wo6glp9s</link><description>SBS Finance Editor Ricardo Gonçalves speaks with Ben Clark from TMS Private Wealth about the day&amp;apos;s market action including a software sell-off in the US which is trickling to Australia, plus what the fall in the bitcoin price says about the economic and investment environment.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">a38f8fc84ed9cc20ae740f5902428444</guid></item><item><title>AFP confirms it won&amp;apos;t arrest Israeli President Isaac Herzog amid calls for investigation</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/australian-federal-police-confirms-it-wont-arrest-israeli-president-isaac-herzog/0ir4q4vq3</link><description>The Australian Federal Police has confirmed it has sought independent legal advice about how to handle the president of Israel&amp;apos;s upcoming visit to Australia.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">412895fc4038dbc3a05095c5b75c306b</guid></item></channel></rss>
