But Palau is already facing the immediate reality of climate change, with rising sea levels, coral bleaching, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss. Surangel Whipps Junior, the President of Palau, has spoken at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and wants to see the COP31 global climate conference held in the Pacific region rather than in Turkiye, because this is where climate change is already having devastating impacts.

It&amp;apos;s the first government shutdown in nearly seven years. The last and also the longest federal government shutdown occurred from late 2018 to early 2019 during President Trump&amp;apos;s first term when Democrats opposed funding the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The result was a shutdown lasting over five weeks, during which some 800,000 federal employees were forced to work without pay or take unpaid leave. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be forced to take unpaid leave this time too, with some public services potentially suspended or delayed, and the release of economic data possibly impacted as well. Bruce Wolpe is a senior fellow at the University of Sydney&amp;apos;s United States Studies Centre and has served on the Democratic staff in the US Congress. He&amp;apos;s been speaking to SBS&amp;apos;s Virginia Langeberg about the impact of the shutdown.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">43aabe12548320f0c34d8f8378765ad2</guid></item><item><title>Man cleared of involvement after police swoop on property in search for Dezi Freeman</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/man-cleared-of-involvement-after-police-swoop-on-rural-property-as-part-of-search-for-fugitive-dezi-freeman/igl2yw2r6</link><description>Police hunting Australia&amp;apos;s most wanted fugitive have targeted an area far away from where he was last sighted after he allegedly shot dead two officers.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">7831b5073994f3eeaf5593218d02a48c</guid></item><item><title>Man cleared of involvement after police swoop on property in search for Dezi Freeman</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/planned-operation-in-search-for-fugitive-dezi-freeman-in-benalla/igl2yw2r6</link><description>Police hunting Australia&amp;apos;s most wanted fugitive have targeted an area far away from where he was last sighted after he allegedly shot dead two officers.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ded7627d9a1380097dbd6561d2325296</guid></item><item><title>Man cleared of involvement after police swoop on property in search for Dezi Freeman</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/man-cleared-of-involvement-after-police-swoop-on-property-in-search-for-dezi-freeman/igl2yw2r6</link><description>Police hunting Australia&amp;apos;s most wanted fugitive have targeted an area far away from where he was last sighted after he allegedly shot dead two officers.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">556a09f354709d0d686cfd8197cc9bb8</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;No more signs of life&amp;apos;: Dozens remain missing after Indonesian school collapse</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/91-children-still-missing-after-indonesian-school-building-collapse/l4aps5xg5</link><description>After days of rescue operations, 59 people were still feared buried under the rubble after at least five people had been confirmed dead.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">10c1787f60aefe5ecf75c329a17da7a8</guid></item><item><title>Is your sunscreen safe?

The Global Sumud Flotilla consists of more than 40 civilian boats carrying about 500 parliamentarians, lawyers and activists including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. The organisers say they are trying to break Israel&amp;apos;s blockade of Gaza, despite repeated warnings from Israel to turn back. The United Nations last month ruled that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza, a claim Israel denies. Israel has imposed a naval blockade on Gaza since Hamas took control of the coastal enclave in 2007 and they claim it is a legal part of the action they are taking against Hamas. They&amp;apos;ve accused the flotilla of having connections to Hamas - which the organisers strongly deny, while other critics accuse them of grandstanding. Judy Patterson&amp;apos;s son, Hamish, is the captain of the Wahoo, one of the ships taking part in the action, and she spoke to SBS&amp;apos;s Tee Mitchell.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">8fc72ddbc50eebbb6ffe2fe1950cb84e</guid></item><item><title>Nuclear energy sank the Coalition at the election — can it power their comeback?</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/nuclear-energy-sank-the-coalition-at-the-election-can-it-power-their-comeback/eqd6mzqsd</link><description>The coalition are revamping their proposal for nuclear energy, despite suffering an election loss with this policy.
