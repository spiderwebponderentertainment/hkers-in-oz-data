But it&amp;apos;s not just in Australia where migration has created such deep feelings - it&amp;apos;s also an issue that has been front and centre in the US as Donald Trump fulfils his election campaign promise to carry out mass deportations. There are now at least a million fewer immigrants in the US, raising questions about the impact of their absence on key industries like agriculture and construction. Migration is also a major concern in Europe, which has long grappled with what to do with the scores of people fleeing war and poverty in their home countries. This episode of the TOO HARD BASKET focuses on these complexities.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">94a74b43b5d6abf4754d72ad1f63660e</guid></item><item><title>Australian women are living longer but it&amp;apos;s not all good news</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/australian-women-are-living-longer-but-its-not-all-good-news/c1eyxv21t</link><description>The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has produced a snap shot of Women’s health across the life course.
