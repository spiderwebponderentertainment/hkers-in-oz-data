Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found that around 43,200 people with a history of homelessness died between 2012 and 2013 alone from these types of causes. The median age was 55 years, far lower than the Australian median life expectancy of 81.1 years for men and 85.1 years for women. For women, gendered violence remains a leading cause of homelessness across Australia, impacting almost 67,000 people every year. Kate Colvin is the CEO of Homelessness Australia and she&amp;apos;s been talking to SBS&amp;apos;s Cameron Carr.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">6336def546ee853bd8f839b86fd51ed2</guid></item><item><title>The &amp;apos;horrendous&amp;apos; gamble of fast-tracking the Trump-Albanese critical minerals deal</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-horrendous-gamble-of-fast-tracking-the-trump-albanese-critical-minerals-deal/fiuyhfm7d</link><description>The $13 billion deal has been widely celebrated, but some warn &amp;quot;stark changes&amp;quot; pose a risk to the environment and food.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ed229da364a8abbae0e7e4c1640e6d99</guid></item><item><title>Are aliens from space waiting to invade?

Spoiler alert - NASA says it isn&amp;apos;t. But even so, the fears of alien invasion are nothing new: in the final years of the nineteenth century, in his novel War of the Worlds, British author H G Wells wrote that &amp;apos;minds immeasurably greater than our own, across the gulf of space, made their plans against us&amp;apos;. So what is the likelihood of an alien invasion?
