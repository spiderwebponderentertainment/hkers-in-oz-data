Data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that some of the most common illnesses in the world are becoming more resistant to treatment every year. Dr Maud Eijkenboom says the current approach of developing new antibiotics is losing the battle against ever-evolving viruses and bacteria. After her son struggled with a resistant disease, Dr Eijkenboom set on her own path to discover a better way eradicate the rising wave of lethal pathogens. In 2021, she founded Lixa, a Perth-based biotech company receiving international support for its “game-changing” research. In this edition of Weekend One on One, she speaks with SBS&amp;apos;s Cameron Carr about the impact of her research, and started by explaining what Lixa is all about.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ddacb0ccac6e8eba690382971431687b</guid></item><item><title>Minneapolis Indigenous leaders, community, hold memorial service as US Senate debates ICE funding</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/minneapolis-indigenous-leaders-community-hold-memorial-service-as-us-senate-debates-ice-funding/22n0ihvc4</link><description>Indigenous leaders and community members in Minneapolis have held a memorial honouring two people shot dead by immigration officers last month.
