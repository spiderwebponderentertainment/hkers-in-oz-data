Dr Dominic McAfee has been playing this sound underwater to help regenerate natural oyster reefs. He&amp;apos;s been doing this work for years, but recently, there&amp;apos;s been an upswell in interest, as the South Australian government tries to increase resilience against a harmful algal bloom. The ongoing environmental crisis has killed hundreds of species and resulted in tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands of marine deaths. Dr McAfee says South Australia used to be home to huge oyster reefs, which would have curbed the intensity of the algal bloom because they naturally filter the water. He’s speaking here with SBS&amp;apos;s Tee Mitchell, who started by asking about the role and extent of oyster reefs before colonisation.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">f864e21d1ac8ac91530408173825f28f</guid></item><item><title>Christmas lights return to Bethlehem for first time since Gaza war</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/bethlehem-christmas-lights-gaza-war/72u27hiyp</link><description>A giant Christmas tree adorned with red and gold baubles stands in the West Bank city of Bethlehem for the first time since 2022.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">13eab7ee107bf4465a459d58b4cc1745</guid></item><item><title>Minister defends taxpayer-funded trips as Coalition pushes for independent review</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/anika-wells-defends-taxpayer-funded-trip-costs/kc6e3jizp</link><description>The communications minister is not indicating she will pay back any money as she comes under renewed fire for the cost of taxpayer-funded trips.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">50f83d7a2b66e079b5d7b94a46874ca5</guid></item><item><title>Migrant workers like Ethel feel abandoned by this scrutinised government scheme</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/migrant-workers-like-ethel-feel-abandoned-by-this-scrutinised-government-scheme/mpx0ie0pc</link><description>The Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme, often known as the PALM scheme, allows eligible Australian businesses to hire workers from the Pacific for either short-term or long-term roles.

As they wrapped up a 12-day tour of facilities across the country, preliminary findings raise substantial concerns around the over-representation of First Nations people, punitive policies that target children, rising rates of remand and mandatory detention, among other issues. The federal immigration detention regime was also found to contravene fundamental international human rights norms - including the Commonwealth&amp;apos;s recent deal with Nauru to deport stateless people. Australia’s Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay says the findings show Australia is not complying with key international human rights commitments it has made to the world. She’s speaking here with Tee Mitchell.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">220ce1321c5f75b240a171cfffbb2a59</guid></item><item><title>Wanted in Hong Kong, now this China critic&amp;apos;s wife is being targeted in Australia</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/hong-kong-activist-wife-harassment/v4f2l37s2</link><description>Ted Hui, who lives in Australia in exile from Hong Kong, described the incident targeting his wife as &amp;quot;immoral&amp;quot;.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">0db47fee1557e34ad51e7d3288ac1f3a</guid></item><item><title>What we know so far as NSW Police declare Bondi shooting terrorist incident</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/bondi-beach-police-operation/7df0l9ks9</link><description>At least 16 people have been killed after gunmen opened fire at a crowd at Bondi Beach with footage showing a man disarming one of the gunmen.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">2666a9c4a9e735df90dc31a94476065f</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;An attack on one is an attack on all&amp;apos;: Communities united in grief after Bondi terror attack</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/bondi-terror-attack-community-response/nzm1aqnka</link><description>Faith and community leaders have urged calm, compassion and solidarity in the wake of the Bondi terror attack.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">6747bfdaa822e1fe9f5824997add2d6c</guid></item><item><title>Mary gave birth to her son in Australia.
