As they wrapped up a 12-day tour of facilities across the country, preliminary findings raise substantial concerns around the over-representation of First Nations people, punitive policies that target children, rising rates of remand and mandatory detention, among other issues. The federal immigration detention regime was also found to contravene fundamental international human rights norms - including the Commonwealth&amp;apos;s recent deal with Nauru to deport stateless people. Australia’s Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay says the findings show Australia is not complying with key international human rights commitments it has made to the world. She’s speaking here with Tee Mitchell.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">220ce1321c5f75b240a171cfffbb2a59</guid></item><item><title>What we know so far as NSW Police declare Bondi shooting terrorist incident</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/bondi-beach-police-operation/7df0l9ks9</link><description>At least 16 people have been killed after gunmen opened fire at a crowd at Bondi Beach with footage showing a man disarming one of the gunmen.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">2666a9c4a9e735df90dc31a94476065f</guid></item><item><title>Mary gave birth to her son in Australia.

The National Firearms Agreement was introduced after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre to standardise rules about who could own a gun - and why. But experts on firearms legislation say some holes in the rules have become apparent. In New South Wales, applications to have a firearms licence are handled by the Gun Registry - which came under intense scrutiny after a tragic murder suicide in 2018, when an estranged father, John Edwards, fatally shot his teenage children. He had a history of domestic violence which hadn&amp;apos;t been flagged to the Gun Registry. Not all the changes recommended after the Edwards inquest have been implemented. Deborah Groarke spoke to Maya Arguello who&amp;apos;s a law and criminology expert at the Swinburne University of Technology.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ed71de71a02654ee40aa1d5597a5433b</guid></item><item><title>SBS News in Easy English 16 December 2025</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/sbs-news-in-easy-english-16-december-2025/zmvrzkkt7</link><description>A daily 5-minute news wrap for English learners and people with disability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">3d18e8915a9924994ca95dee456c2fd0</guid></item><item><title>Donald Trump condemned for &amp;apos;disrespectful&amp;apos; attack on Rob Reiner after director&amp;apos;s death</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/trump-backlash-rob-reiner-death/1mtpj8eb0</link><description>Trump mocked Rob Reiner in a social media post after the director-actor and his wife Michele were found dead.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ffe9c977ac22d7c48ed9f4fb28e81162</guid></item><item><title>CBA &amp;amp; NAB predict February rate rise</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/cba-nab-predict-february-rate-rise/id8hbdno8</link><description>SBS Finance Editor Ricardo Gonçalves speaks with Jonathan Shead from State Street Investment Management about the day&amp;apos;s market action including where interest rates are going and the opportunities for investors in 2026.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5ec3759611051525b4adfb35aac5cbd3</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;Different blind spots&amp;apos;: Where are the gaps in Australia&amp;apos;s gun laws?</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/australia-gun-laws-reform-after-bondi-terror-attack/eahlvodi6</link><description>The Bondi Beach massacre has renewed focus on Australia&amp;apos;s gun laws, nearly three decades after the Port Arthur reforms.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">d8946601903b3a61102c770079529391</guid></item><item><title>Opposition puts migration policy on ice after Bondi Beach massacre</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/opposition-migration-policy-bondi-beach-attack/ibn3gotg6</link><description>The Opposition will instead prioritise the formation of an antisemitism and counter-terrorism taskforce.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">1f2782480be3a449b669b8c9bce0e4af</guid></item><item><title>Amandeep ate a kebab as the sun set — then helped stop one of the alleged Bondi shooters</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/amandeep-ate-a-kebab-then-jumped-on-top-of-the-bondi-beach-shooter/5bhs6v8ef</link><description>One of the many heroes who sprang into action after Sunday&amp;apos;s attack says &amp;quot;now, more than ever, we need each other&amp;quot;.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">fb1ce90f1c495bee7a3b1666c8389239</guid></item><item><title>I have never earned more money, but I&amp;apos;ve never felt more broke</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/insight/article/i-have-never-earned-more-money-but-ive-never-felt-more-broke/31hheaflf</link><description>Chris Booy works three jobs.
