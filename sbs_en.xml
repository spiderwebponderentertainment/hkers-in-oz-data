He was the first Singaporean footballer to play in Europe, the first Singaporean millionaire sportsperson and the first Singaporean sportsperson to have a published biography.

Surangel Whipps Junior, the President of Palau, has spoken at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and wants to see the COP31 global climate conference held in the Pacific region rather than in Turkiye, because this is where climate change is already having devastating impacts. He&amp;apos;s been talking to SBS Senior International Correspondent Ben Lewis, and told him that Palau and Australia are family - and the two countries need to work together.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">3bc8d99d4218ddff18c78bb6e03b40e1</guid></item><item><title>The effects of Tonga&amp;apos;s massive volcanic explosion linger, three years on</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/the-effects-of-tongas-massive-volcanic-explosion-linger-three-years-on/ro26186xy</link><description>It&amp;apos;s been more than three and a half years since one of the most powerful volcanic eruptions in recent history left devastation in Tonga.
