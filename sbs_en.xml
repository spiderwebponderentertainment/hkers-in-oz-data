In Mildura, in Victoria&amp;apos;s far northwest, the mercury hit 48.6 Celsius. And when coastal areas enjoyed a reprieve, the inland still had to cope with an extended heatwave that lasted a week. Experts say these kinds of phenomena are going to intensify over time because of the impacts of climate change - but while there has been plenty of coverage of how that impacts on urban centres, regional Australia has not received the same attention. SBS visited Mildura to see how the region felt the heat, and what they&amp;apos;re doing to cope with climate change at a local level.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e530a064349eb49a4668efe5fd936f34</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;Bloodbath&amp;apos;: Mass layoffs at Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/washington-post-layoffs/y2dd49wsv</link><description>The shrinking of the prominent masthead comes as major media outlets in the US face intense pressure from Donald Trump.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">3a84e5765efdb90a112b2f37ac6da267</guid></item><item><title>Iran-US nuclear talks back on, set for Friday in Oman</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-in-oman/ee9dz5d3m</link><description>Talks will go ahead following weeks of increasing tensions between the two countries.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">6dcb89b6f084507dda8abfa51a51d45c</guid></item><item><title>Bondi stabbings: &amp;apos;Major failing&amp;apos; in mental health care of killer, inquest finds</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/bondi-stabbing-inquest-findings-handed-down/yxmsv2val</link><description>The coroner said Joel Cauchi&amp;apos;s psychiatrist failed to act on warning signs.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">38552da847896d1b07ff110f49867aa2</guid></item><item><title>Dozens killed in Israeli strikes, movement paused after Rafah crossing partially reopened</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/fresh-strikes-crossings-suspended-whats-happened-since-israel-partially-reopened-rafah/ktmmnfgbl</link><description>Fresh Israeli strikes and reported disruptions to patient evacuations have followed the partial reopening of Gaza&amp;apos;s Rafah crossing.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">130e69356d33c61dec25eb39586f5c65</guid></item><item><title>Coroner hands down inquest findings into Bondi mass stabbing | SBS News In Easy English 5 February 2026</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/coroner-hands-down-inquest-findings-into-bondi-mass-stabbing-sbs-news-in-easy-english-5-february-2026/pwuk6gacb</link><description>A daily 5-minute news bulletin for English learners and people with a disability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c538d4213fcbd73fce0d7993e7e80b38</guid></item><item><title>Police say a suspect has been identified in the disappearance of four-year-old Gus Lamont</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/sa-police-gus-lamont-major-crime/8kdl6a9kn</link><description>The four-year-old was reported missing from a remote South Australian sheep station in September.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">6faeba15f7cba39b13415d0d6fbb8f8c</guid></item><item><title>Trump v Iran, the huge Epstein dump and Melania’s hundred-million-dollar doco bomb</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/trump-v-iran-the-huge-epstein-dump-and-melanias-hundred-million-dollar-doco-bomb/igeaxz98s</link><description>The US and Iran tussle over talks to stave off more strikes, millions more Epstein documents touch the rich and powerful the world over from Elon Musk to the Norwegian princess-royal and more trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi don’t stop the destruction across Ukraine.

Data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that some of the most common illnesses in the world are becoming more resistant to treatment every year. Dr Maud Eijkenboom says the current approach of developing new antibiotics is losing the battle against ever-evolving viruses and bacteria. After her son struggled with a resistant disease, Dr Eijkenboom set on her own path to discover a better way eradicate the rising wave of lethal pathogens. In 2021, she founded Lixa, a Perth-based biotech company receiving international support for its “game-changing” research. In this edition of Weekend One on One, she speaks with SBS&amp;apos;s Cameron Carr about the impact of her research, and started by explaining what Lixa is all about.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ddacb0ccac6e8eba690382971431687b</guid></item><item><title>Japan&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Iron Lady&amp;quot; Takaichi secures sweeping mandate for conservative agenda in landslide election</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/japans-iron-lady-takaichi-secures-sweeping-mandate-for-conservative-agenda-in-landslide-election/zldf0e2it</link><description>Japan&amp;apos;s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has won the country&amp;apos;s election In a landslide victory, with her party expected to secure a more than two-thirds majority in the powerful lower house.
