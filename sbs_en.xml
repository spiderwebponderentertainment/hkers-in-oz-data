The National Firearms Agreement was introduced after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre to standardise rules about who could own a gun - and why. But experts on firearms legislation say some holes in the rules have become apparent. In New South Wales, applications to have a firearms licence are handled by the Gun Registry - which came under intense scrutiny after a tragic murder suicide in 2018, when an estranged father, John Edwards, fatally shot his teenage children. He had a history of domestic violence which hadn&amp;apos;t been flagged to the Gun Registry. Not all the changes recommended after the Edwards inquest have been implemented. Deborah Groarke spoke to Maya Arguello who&amp;apos;s a law and criminology expert at the Swinburne University of Technology.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ed71de71a02654ee40aa1d5597a5433b</guid></item><item><title>SBS News in Easy English 16 December 2025</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/sbs-news-in-easy-english-16-december-2025/zmvrzkkt7</link><description>A daily 5-minute news wrap for English learners and people with disability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">3d18e8915a9924994ca95dee456c2fd0</guid></item><item><title>More details emerge about Islamic State group links of Bondi gunmen</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/more-details-emerge-about-islamic-state-group-links-of-bondi-gunmen/bgqx2rzal</link><description>.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">a07aa60439224e3eb9fdb20d02292f01</guid></item><item><title>Donald Trump condemned for &amp;apos;disrespectful&amp;apos; attack on Rob Reiner after director&amp;apos;s death</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/trump-backlash-rob-reiner-death/1mtpj8eb0</link><description>Trump mocked Rob Reiner in a social media post after the director-actor and his wife Michele were found dead.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ffe9c977ac22d7c48ed9f4fb28e81162</guid></item><item><title>CBA &amp;amp; NAB predict February rate rise</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/cba-nab-predict-february-rate-rise/id8hbdno8</link><description>SBS Finance Editor Ricardo Gonçalves speaks with Jonathan Shead from State Street Investment Management about the day&amp;apos;s market action including where interest rates are going and the opportunities for investors in 2026.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5ec3759611051525b4adfb35aac5cbd3</guid></item><item><title>Opposition puts migration policy on ice after Bondi Beach massacre</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/opposition-migration-policy-bondi-beach-attack/ibn3gotg6</link><description>The Opposition will instead prioritise the formation of an antisemitism and counter-terrorism taskforce.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">1f2782480be3a449b669b8c9bce0e4af</guid></item><item><title>Amandeep ate a kebab as the sun set — then helped stop one of the alleged Bondi shooters</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/amandeep-ate-a-kebab-then-jumped-on-top-of-the-bondi-beach-shooter/5bhs6v8ef</link><description>One of the many heroes who sprang into action after Sunday&amp;apos;s attack says &amp;quot;now, more than ever, we need each other&amp;quot;.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">fb1ce90f1c495bee7a3b1666c8389239</guid></item><item><title>I have never earned more money, but I&amp;apos;ve never felt more broke</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/insight/article/i-have-never-earned-more-money-but-ive-never-felt-more-broke/31hheaflf</link><description>Chris Booy works three jobs.
