Dr Dominic McAfee has been playing this sound underwater to help regenerate natural oyster reefs. He&amp;apos;s been doing this work for years, but recently, there&amp;apos;s been an upswell in interest, as the South Australian government tries to increase resilience against a harmful algal bloom. The ongoing environmental crisis has killed hundreds of species and resulted in tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands of marine deaths. Dr McAfee says South Australia used to be home to huge oyster reefs, which would have curbed the intensity of the algal bloom because they naturally filter the water. He’s speaking here with SBS&amp;apos;s Tee Mitchell, who started by asking about the role and extent of oyster reefs before colonisation.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">f864e21d1ac8ac91530408173825f28f</guid></item><item><title>Christmas lights return to Bethlehem for first time since Gaza war</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/bethlehem-christmas-lights-gaza-war/72u27hiyp</link><description>A giant Christmas tree adorned with red and gold baubles stands in the West Bank city of Bethlehem for the first time since 2022.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">13eab7ee107bf4465a459d58b4cc1745</guid></item><item><title>&amp;apos;A very painful day&amp;apos;: India nightclub fire in Goa leaves 25 people dead</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/nightclub-fire-in-goa-india-kills-23/hzfqlwvge</link><description>A fire in a nightclub in India&amp;apos;s tourist hot spot of Goa has killed 25 people.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">a1ca59c871bf7546df7d872f8f983cf2</guid></item><item><title>Minister defends taxpayer-funded trips as Coalition pushes for independent review</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/anika-wells-defends-taxpayer-funded-trip-costs/kc6e3jizp</link><description>The communications minister is not indicating she will pay back any money as she comes under renewed fire for the cost of taxpayer-funded trips.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">50f83d7a2b66e079b5d7b94a46874ca5</guid></item><item><title>Fears for thousands of Afghans in Australia amid &amp;apos;secrecy&amp;apos; over potential shutdown</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/afghan-embassy-australia-secrecy/0a6rsztq1</link><description>Senator Fatima Payman said the Afghan embassy&amp;apos;s closure would be &amp;apos;the second fall of Afghanistan&amp;apos;.
