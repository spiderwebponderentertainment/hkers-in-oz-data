In Mildura, in Victoria&amp;apos;s far northwest, the mercury hit 48.6 Celsius. And when coastal areas enjoyed a reprieve, the inland still had to cope with an extended heatwave that lasted a week. Experts say these kinds of phenomena are going to intensify over time because of the impacts of climate change - but while there has been plenty of coverage of how that impacts on urban centres, regional Australia has not received the same attention. SBS visited Mildura to see how the region felt the heat, and what they&amp;apos;re doing to cope with climate change at a local level.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e530a064349eb49a4668efe5fd936f34</guid></item><item><title>Coroner hands down inquest findings into Bondi mass stabbing | SBS News In Easy English 5 February 2026</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/coroner-hands-down-inquest-findings-into-bondi-mass-stabbing-sbs-news-in-easy-english-5-february-2026/pwuk6gacb</link><description>A daily 5-minute news bulletin for English learners and people with a disability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c538d4213fcbd73fce0d7993e7e80b38</guid></item><item><title>Police say a suspect has been identified in the disappearance of four-year-old Gus Lamont</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/sa-police-gus-lamont-major-crime/8kdl6a9kn</link><description>The four-year-old was reported missing from a remote South Australian sheep station in September.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">6faeba15f7cba39b13415d0d6fbb8f8c</guid></item><item><title>Trump v Iran, the huge Epstein dump and Melania’s hundred-million-dollar doco bomb</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/trump-v-iran-the-huge-epstein-dump-and-melanias-hundred-million-dollar-doco-bomb/igeaxz98s</link><description>The US and Iran tussle over talks to stave off more strikes, millions more Epstein documents touch the rich and powerful the world over from Elon Musk to the Norwegian princess-royal and more trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi don’t stop the destruction across Ukraine.

That&amp;apos;s the shocking finding from the Cancer Council Australia’s latest national survey, which suggests the financial burden arises from both direct medical costs and indirect expenses at every stage of the cancer journey. The cost of accessing care and treatment hits First Nations communities especially hard, with Indigenous Australians ultimately facing a higher mortality rate for blood cancer.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">deb22260f1510372cca3cbf1f5214ff9</guid></item><item><title>Democracy is under threat warns Human Rights Watch, set back to the 1980s</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/democracy-is-under-threat-warns-human-rights-watch-set-back-to-the-1980s/m1qp10l6t</link><description>Democracy and the rules-based international order are under threat, according to the latest annual report by Human Rights Watch.

Data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that some of the most common illnesses in the world are becoming more resistant to treatment every year. Dr Maud Eijkenboom says the current approach of developing new antibiotics is losing the battle against ever-evolving viruses and bacteria. After her son struggled with a resistant disease, Dr Eijkenboom set on her own path to discover a better way eradicate the rising wave of lethal pathogens. In 2021, she founded Lixa, a Perth-based biotech company receiving international support for its “game-changing” research. In this edition of Weekend One on One, she speaks with SBS&amp;apos;s Cameron Carr about the impact of her research, and started by explaining what Lixa is all about.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ddacb0ccac6e8eba690382971431687b</guid></item><item><title>Japan&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Iron Lady&amp;quot; Takaichi secures sweeping mandate for conservative agenda in landslide election</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/japans-iron-lady-takaichi-secures-sweeping-mandate-for-conservative-agenda-in-landslide-election/zldf0e2it</link><description>Japan&amp;apos;s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has won the country&amp;apos;s election In a landslide victory, with her party expected to secure a more than two-thirds majority in the powerful lower house.
