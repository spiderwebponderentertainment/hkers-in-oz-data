Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found that around 43,200 people with a history of homelessness died between 2012 and 2013 alone from these types of causes. The median age was 55 years, far lower than the Australian median life expectancy of 81.1 years for men and 85.1 years for women. For women, gendered violence remains a leading cause of homelessness across Australia, impacting almost 67,000 people every year.

But even so, the fears of alien invasion are nothing new: in the final years of the nineteenth century, in his novel War of the Worlds, British author H G Wells wrote that &amp;apos;minds immeasurably greater than our own, across the gulf of space, made their plans against us&amp;apos;.

It&amp;apos;s expected to enter force by the end of the year, after an official signing ceremony and royal assent from Victoria&amp;apos;s governor, in the culmination of a whole decade of negotiations. The legislation establishes a permanent Aboriginal advisory and decision-making body, to be known as Gellung Warl, which will remain outside the state&amp;apos;s constitution. Aunty Jill Gallagher is the C-E-O of the Victorian Community Controlled Health Organisation, and served as the Treaty Advancement Commissioner in 2018.

Professor Graeme Samuel has told SBS the bill implements the &amp;apos;totality&amp;apos; of the recommendations he made in his report, five years after it was delivered. The Greens and Coalition have objected to the bill, with Greens leader Larissa Waters describing it as 1400 pages gift-wrapped for big business. But Professor Samuel says environmental groups and business interests alike had substantial input into his report, and their desires were fully taken into account in the recommendations.
