Chikungunya causes fever and joint pain, but in some cases can be fatal. There is no vaccine or real treatment. Epidemiologist Jason Rasgon, from Penn State University, explains how the disease is transmitted, and why it seems to be spreading to new areas. The chikungunya virus is not currently endemic in Australia. There have been no locally acquired cases, though mosquitoes capable of spreading the virus are present in some areas of Queensland, and travellers can become infected with the chikungunya virus if travelling to a region of the world where chikungunya is found.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">a7a891cd2de6034242d24878ee1c5a54</guid></item><item><title>Unprecedented bleaching across WA&amp;apos;s reefs from last year&amp;apos;s marine heatwave</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/unprecedented-bleaching-across-was-reefs-from-last-years-marine-heatwave/hjn7lr9r3</link><description>Last summer&amp;apos;s marine heat wave was the largest and most intense on record in Western Australia, says a new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science.

While these two creatures appeared to have lived at the same time - and in the same place - they are two distinct, different hominins. The team says one set of fossils appears to be a fit for the genus Homo. That’s the same genus as modern humans. The other seems to fit Australopithecus, the same genus as the famous Lucy fossil. Fossil teeth and bones from both creatures were found at Ledi-Geraru in Ethiopia. It’s a desert site about 30 miles from where the famous Lucy fossil was found. But the research team concluded that the Ledi-Geraru Australopithecus teeth are a new species, rather than belonging to Lucy’s species, Australopithecus afarensis. The new Homo teeth also don’t appear to match any known Homo species. These new fossils date between 2.6 and 2.8 million years ago, and shed new light on human evolution. They are younger than the Lucy fossil, which is dated as being about 3.2 million years old. In this edition of Weekend One on One we hear from two members of the research team, Chris Campisano and Kaye Reed from Arizona State University in the US.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">3488e136634a114ce76a2d998d3d853c</guid></item><item><title>Love, warmth, &amp;apos;gentle smacks&amp;apos;.

But it&amp;apos;s not just in Australia where migration has created such deep feelings - it&amp;apos;s also an issue that has been front and centre in the US as Donald Trump fulfils his election campaign promise to carry out mass deportations. There are now at least a million fewer immigrants in the US, raising questions about the impact of their absence on key industries like agriculture and construction. Migration is also a major concern in Europe, which has long grappled with what to do with the scores of people fleeing war and poverty in their home countries. This episode of the TOO HARD BASKET focuses on these complexities.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">94a74b43b5d6abf4754d72ad1f63660e</guid></item><item><title>Australian women are living longer but it&amp;apos;s not all good news</title><link>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/podcast-episode/australian-women-are-living-longer-but-its-not-all-good-news/c1eyxv21t</link><description>The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has produced a snap shot of Women’s health across the life course.
