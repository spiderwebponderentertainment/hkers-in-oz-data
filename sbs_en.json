SBS&apos;s Stephanie Youssef spoke with ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb about whether AI is creating a new generation of digital monopolies and why it&apos;s calling for stronger monitoring powers to keep pace with the evolving industry.",

The National Firearms Agreement was introduced after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre to standardise rules about who could own a gun - and why. But experts on firearms legislation say some holes in the rules have become apparent. In New South Wales, applications to have a firearms licence are handled by the Gun Registry - which came under intense scrutiny after a tragic murder suicide in 2018, when an estranged father, John Edwards, fatally shot his teenage children. He had a history of domestic violence which hadn&apos;t been flagged to the Gun Registry. Not all the changes recommended after the Edwards inquest have been implemented. Deborah Groarke spoke to Maya Arguello who&apos;s a law and criminology expert at the Swinburne University of Technology.",

As they wrapped up a 12-day tour of facilities across the country, preliminary findings raise substantial concerns around the over-representation of First Nations people, punitive policies that target children, rising rates of remand and mandatory detention, among other issues. The federal immigration detention regime was also found to contravene fundamental international human rights norms - including the Commonwealth&apos;s recent deal with Nauru to deport stateless people. Australia’s Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay says the findings show Australia is not complying with key international human rights commitments it has made to the world.
