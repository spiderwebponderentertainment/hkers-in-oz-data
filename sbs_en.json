The ongoing environmental crisis has killed hundreds of species and resulted in tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands of marine deaths. Dr McAfee says South Australia used to be home to huge oyster reefs, which would have curbed the intensity of the algal bloom because they naturally filter the water. He’s speaking here with SBS&apos;s Tee Mitchell, who started by asking about the role and extent of oyster reefs before colonisation.",

After the European Broadcasting Union formally confirmed Israel’s eligibility for the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, four countries - Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland and Slovenia - immediately withdrew. Their walkout has triggered one of the most serious disputes in the contest’s modern history, raising questions about neutrality, artistic expression and how far Eurovision can distance itself from real-world conflicts.",
