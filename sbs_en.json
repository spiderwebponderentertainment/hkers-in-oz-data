In New South Wales, applications to have a firearms licence are handled by the Gun Registry - which came under intense scrutiny after a tragic murder suicide in 2018, when an estranged father, John Edwards, fatally shot his teenage children. He had a history of domestic violence which hadn&apos;t been flagged to the Gun Registry. Not all the changes recommended after the Edwards inquest have been implemented.

As they wrapped up a 12-day tour of facilities across the country, preliminary findings raise substantial concerns around the over-representation of First Nations people, punitive policies that target children, rising rates of remand and mandatory detention, among other issues. The federal immigration detention regime was also found to contravene fundamental international human rights norms - including the Commonwealth&apos;s recent deal with Nauru to deport stateless people. Australia’s Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay says the findings show Australia is not complying with key international human rights commitments it has made to the world.
