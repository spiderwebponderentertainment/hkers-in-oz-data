      "summary": "Iran’s nationwide communications blackout has entered its second week, severely limiting access to real-time information about the deadly crackdown on anti-government protesters. Iranian authorities have warned that those taking part in the protests could face the death penalty, as reports suggest the death toll has risen to around 2,000. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has urged Iranians to continue protesting against the country’s leadership, telling demonstrators that “help is on its way.”",
