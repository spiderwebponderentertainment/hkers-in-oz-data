It follows what the government is calling its no assistance policy for 34 citizens recently turned back by Syrian authorities. While the Prime Minister insists those who joined the IS Group must live with their choices, legal and human rights experts argue that abandoning children and coerced women in detention camps poses a greater long-term radicalisation risk than bringing them home to Australia.",
