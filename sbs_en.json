      "summary": "For many in Australia&apos;s south-east, the day after Australia Day brought sweltering conditions and record temperatures. In Mildura, in Victoria&apos;s far northwest, the mercury hit 48.6 Celsius. And when coastal areas enjoyed a reprieve, the inland still had to cope with an extended heatwave that lasted a week. Experts say these kinds of phenomena are going to intensify over time because of the impacts of climate change - but while there has been plenty of coverage of how that impacts on urban centres, regional Australia has not received the same attention. SBS visited Mildura to see how the region felt the heat, and what they&apos;re doing to cope with climate change at a local level.",
