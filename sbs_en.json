For more on this, Stephanie Youssef spoke with HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham. Despite the decision, the Australian share market finished the session strong, amid a strong global stocks rebound that included a gold and silver price recovery. For more, Stephanie Youssef spoke with Mark Gardner, CEO at MPC Markets.",
