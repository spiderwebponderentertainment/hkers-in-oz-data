The Global Sumud Flotilla consists of more than 40 civilian boats carrying about 500 parliamentarians, lawyers and activists including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. The organisers say they are trying to break Israel&apos;s blockade of Gaza, despite repeated warnings from Israel to turn back. The United Nations last month ruled that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza, a claim Israel denies. Israel has imposed a naval blockade on Gaza since Hamas took control of the coastal enclave in 2007 and they claim it is a legal part of the action they are taking against Hamas. They&apos;ve accused the flotilla of having connections to Hamas - which the organisers strongly deny, while other critics accuse them of grandstanding. Judy Patterson&apos;s son, Hamish, is the captain of the Wahoo, one of the ships taking part in the action, and she spoke to SBS&apos;s Tee Mitchell.",

      "summary": "The U.S. federal government has entered a shutdown, a few hours after the U.S. Senate failed to pass a short-term spending bill on Tuesday night US East Coast time. It&apos;s the first government shutdown in nearly seven years. The last and also the longest federal government shutdown occurred from late 2018 to early 2019 during President Trump&apos;s first term when Democrats opposed funding the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The result was a shutdown lasting over five weeks, during which some 800,000 federal employees were forced to work without pay or take unpaid leave. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be forced to take unpaid leave this time too, with some public services potentially suspended or delayed, and the release of economic data possibly impacted as well. Bruce Wolpe is a senior fellow at the University of Sydney&apos;s United States Studies Centre and has served on the Democratic staff in the US Congress. He&apos;s been speaking to SBS&apos;s Virginia Langeberg about the impact of the shutdown.",
