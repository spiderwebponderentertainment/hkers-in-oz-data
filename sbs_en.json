      "summary": "Victoria&apos;s First Nations community is celebrating a historic milestone - legislation to establish the first treaty in Australia&apos;s history passed through state parliament on Thursday night. It&apos;s expected to enter force by the end of the year, after an official signing ceremony and royal assent from Victoria&apos;s governor, in the culmination of a whole decade of negotiations. The legislation establishes a permanent Aboriginal advisory and decision-making body, to be known as Gellung Warl, which will remain outside the state&apos;s constitution. Aunty Jill Gallagher is the C-E-O of the Victorian Community Controlled Health Organisation, and served as the Treaty Advancement Commissioner in 2018. She&apos;s been talking to SBS&apos;s Tee Mitchell.",

The median age was 55 years, far lower than the Australian median life expectancy of 81.1 years for men and 85.1 years for women. For women, gendered violence remains a leading cause of homelessness across Australia, impacting almost 67,000 people every year.
