While mass protests have subsided amid a crackdown by security forces, a US-based human rights group has confirmed the deaths of more than 6,000 people, warning the total could stand at more than 20,000. Iran&apos;s official death toll is just over 3,000. There are also grave concerns for the tens of thousands who have been arrested.",
