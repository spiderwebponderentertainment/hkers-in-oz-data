Professor Graeme Samuel has told SBS the bill implements the &apos;totality&apos; of the recommendations he made in his report, five years after it was delivered. The Greens and Coalition have objected to the bill, with Greens leader Larissa Waters describing it as 1400 pages gift-wrapped for big business. But Professor Samuel says environmental groups and business interests alike had substantial input into his report, and their desires were fully taken into account in the recommendations. He&apos;s been talking to SBS chief political correspondent Anna Henderson.",
