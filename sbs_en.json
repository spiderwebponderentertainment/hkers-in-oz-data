      "summary": "The director for the International Centre for Journalists says the resignation of two senior figures at the BBC is a result of an &quot;orchestrated campaign to undercut public trust&quot; in the broadcaster. The head of the BBC, director-general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness both resigned after criticism of the broadcaster’s editing of a speech by US President Donald Trump. Critics said the way the speech was edited for the BBC&apos;s flagship documentary program Panorama last year was misleading and cut out a section where Donald Trump said that he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. Mr Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC over the way the speech he made was edited. Julie Posetti is a professor of journalism at City St George&apos;s University of London and director for the International Centre for Journalists and she&apos;s speaking here to AP.",

Mr Cuomo, who resigned as governor four years ago after sexual harassment allegations that he has denied, painted Mr Mamdani as a radical leftist whose proposals were unworkable and dangerous. Mr Mamdani himself has proposed raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy to pay for ambitious policies such as rent freezes, free childcare and free city buses. But like other winning candidates from the off-year elections, Mr Mamdani focused intensely on economic issues, particularly the cost of living, an issue that helped propel U.S. President, Donald Trump, to the White House last year but has remained top-of-mind for voters. In this episode of weeke nd omne-on-one, we hear from Eric Gander, who&apos;s the chair of the Department of Communications at New York&apos;s Baruch College.",
