      "summary": "Dr Jamal Rifi is an Australian doctor who has travelled to Syria to try and bring home a group of Australian women and children being held in an IS-group detention camp. The federal government has been adamant it will not help with the group&apos;s repatriation, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said any of those who do return will face charges if they are found to have broken Australian law. Dr Rifi has with him passports for the cohort of women and children which have been issued by Australian authorities. He also has another passport in his possession-- for an Australian man Yusuf Zahab, who was thought to be dead, until the SBS Dateline program revealed in 2024 he was alive and in a Syrian prison. Dr Jamal Rifi spoke with SBS Chief Political Correspondent Anna Henderson from an undisclosed location.",
