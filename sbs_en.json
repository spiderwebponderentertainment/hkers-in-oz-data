      "summary": "The Bondi Beach shooting has seen state, territory and federal politicians agree that Australia&apos;s already stringent gun laws need to be reviewed and strengthened. The National Firearms Agreement was introduced after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre to standardise rules about who could own a gun - and why. But experts on firearms legislation say some holes in the rules have become apparent. In New South Wales, applications to have a firearms licence are handled by the Gun Registry - which came under intense scrutiny after a tragic murder suicide in 2018, when an estranged father, John Edwards, fatally shot his teenage children. He had a history of domestic violence which hadn&apos;t been flagged to the Gun Registry. Not all the changes recommended after the Edwards inquest have been implemented. Deborah Groarke spoke to Maya Arguello who&apos;s a law and criminology expert at the Swinburne University of Technology.",
